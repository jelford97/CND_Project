that we determine to be synchrotron dominated galaxies. The spectral index for all three of these galaxies is quite negative and the mm continuum point lie mostly in line with the radio power law though NGC3607 could potentially have core variability as the mm continuum points lie in line with thermal modified black body

Aside from NGC1194 the points do not really lie inline with modified black body with NGC0383 being inline with the radio power law and NGC0449 being below the radio power law (which could be due to some of the emission being resolved out). We determine these galaxies are thermal dominated as they have quite steep positive spectral indices
